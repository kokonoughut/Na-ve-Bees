# Project Description
In this project, the goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between a honey bee and a bumble bee. The ability to identify bee species from images is valuable for researchers, enabling them to efficiently collect field data. 
The project utilizes the Python image library Pillow for loading and manipulating image data. Participants will gain knowledge in common image transformations and learn how to construct a pipeline for image processing.

# Project Objectives
- Utilize the Pillow library in Python for loading and manipulating image data.
- Implement common image transformations as part of an image processing pipeline.
- Lay the foundation for building classifiers using traditional machine learning techniques.
